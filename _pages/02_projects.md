  <h2>Directed Forgetting</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Colin Macleod from the psychology department to dispute <a href = 'https://link.springer.com/article/10.3758%2FBF03195325'> a paper </a> concluding that people can intentionally forget things by trying.
  I designed, coded, ran and analyzed two experiments - which to my surprise successfully reproduced the <a href= 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Motivated_forgetting#Directed_forgetting'> "directed forgetting"</a> effect. I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000).  
  
  <h2>Stochastic Volatility Modeling</h2>
  While at the University of Waterloo, I collaborated with Dr. Martin Lysy from the statistics department to compare different stochastic volatility financial models and their ability to predict the S&P 500.
  I received an NSERC undergraduate research award for outstanding research ($5000).
